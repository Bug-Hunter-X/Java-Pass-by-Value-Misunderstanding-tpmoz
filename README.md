This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in Java related to pass-by-value semantics. The code in `Bug.java` shows a method call where the programmer might expect the value of `x` to change within the `MyClass` object after the call to `method2()`. However, because Java uses pass-by-value for primitive types, only a copy of `x` is passed to `method2()`, leaving the original `x` unchanged.  The solution in `Solution.java` shows how to achieve the desired behavior using a wrapper class or returning a modified value from the method.
